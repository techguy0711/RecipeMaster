### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I chose to focus on the code quality ensuring no memory leaks, retain cycles, or slow app performence issues. I like my apps to behave like Apple's apps, smooth and fun to use.
### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
3 hours, 1 hour on implementation, 1 hour on UI, and 1 hour on Repo setup and README info.
### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I would have loved to add some cache so that the images make the scroll view a bit more smooth.
### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
The UI testing, I would spend another hour on the UI testing.
### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I really enjoyed making this app. With given time I would have really enjoyed enabling Swift 6 guardrails for better efficiency on app performence, and I thought of adding SwiftData but decided against it due to time constraints.
